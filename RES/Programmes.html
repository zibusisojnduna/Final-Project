<h1>Our Curriculum</h1>

<p>Our curriculum is split into two parts. From Grade 1 to Grade 3 our students work with the D-CAPS curriculum. From Grade 4 to Grade 5 our students focus mor on developing thier skills and learning new ones. </p>

<h1>What is D-CAPS?</h1>

<p>D-CAPS is an abbreviation for Differentiated Curriculum And Assessment Policy Statement. At its core it is the CAPS system used across South Africa but in this case it is slightly adjusted for our students with disabilies. This programme is structured in such a way that it makes provisions for a large scale of learners with moderate to severe intellectual disabilty and learning difficulties across Grade 1 to 3. The other goal is to help develop their perosnality, talents and creativity, as well as ther mental and physical abilities. </p>

<h1>Skills Development</h1>

<p>From Grade 4 to Grade 5 our students mostly focus on improving skills and developing new ones.These include the likes of leatherwork, woodwork and printing. The students also take part in the agricultrural side of skills including gardening, sewing and garmet making. This is done in the hopes that they can be prepared for life outside if the classroom.</p>
