<h1>School Histroy</h1>
<p>In 1981 Mirriam Qgubule became the first principal in the present existing buildings,</p>
<p>but the school was small at that time.</p>
<p>She initiated in-School Training for teachers to study for a Diploma in Specialized Education through Ex-Department.</p>
<p>In 1991 Mrs Gqubule was transfered to St Martins Special School. The enrolement was 200 hundred at that time.</p>
<p>She worked hard for a number of new developments at EKukhanyeni Special School for the benefits of learners with special Education needs.</p>
<p>Ms M.M. Mthembu retired on 30th of June 2016. The enrolment was 360 at the time. After Ms M.M. Mthembu`s retirement, Mr H.B. Madlala who was the Deputy principal was appointed in the principal position on the 1st of December 2016.</p>
<p>Currently the school has four hundred (400) learners with (High Level of Support) severly intellectual chalenged. Twenty one (21) of the learners are autistic children.</p>

<p>In 1994 the building of the hostel facility started, that there was a very big achivement.The phase of the one of the hostel facility was built and complited.</p>
<p>The phase 2 was completed in 2016.The hostel facility accomodates thirty six girls and thirty six boys.But the other two floors are not used due to the insuffient support and staff and the lack of the furniture and other iterms. </p>
<p>This would be in used if the school get samaritans to assist with those lacking resources. The hostel nutrition facility that is the kitchen and the dinning hall was completed in 2011.</p>
<p>The two additional classrooms were sponsored by Operation Jumpstart in 2010. Three therapy rooms, four classrooms, staff room and adminitrative tiolets were completed in 2014,through the DOE funding </p>
