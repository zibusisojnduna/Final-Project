<h1>School Histroy</h1>
<p>In 1981 Mirriam Gqubule became the first principal in the present existing buildings, but the school was small at that time.She initiated In-Service Training for teachers to study for a Diploma in Specialized Education through Ex-Department of Education.</p>
<p>In 1991 Mrs Gqubule was transfered to St Martins Special School. The enrolement was 200 at that time.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Ms M.M. Mthembu was appointed as the Principal of Ekukhanyeni Special School. She negotiated with the DOE for the establishmend of the hostel to accommodate those learners who lived far away from school.</p>
<p>She worked hard for a number of new developments at Ekukhanyeni Special School for the benefits of learners with special Education needs.</p>
<p>Ms M.M. Mthembu retired on 30th of June 2016. The enrolment was 360 at the time. After Ms M.M. Mthembu's retirement, Mr H.B. Madlala who was the Deputy Principal was appointed in the Principal position on the 1st of December 2016.</p>
<p>Currently the school has four hundred (400) learners with (High Level of Support) severly intellectual chalenged. Twenty one (21) of the learners are autistic children.</p>
<p>The school caters for Foundation Phase to Intermediate Phase , that is Grade 1 to 5. The teaching and learning is in line with D-CAPS that is differentiated and adapted CAPS. Ekukhanyeni Special School is mainly foucused in Skills Developments and Self Discovery of learners with Special Needs.</p>

<h1>Achievements</h1>
<p>Ekukhanyeni Special School excel in extra-mural activities and it boasts of many trophies and medals won by the learners who participated in different sport activities, such as choral music, cultural activities, soccer and netball, cricket, table tennis, athletics and so forth, at regional, provincial and national levels.</p>
<p>In 1994 the building of the hostel facility started, that was a very big achivement. Phase one of the hostel was completed. Phase two was completed in 2016. The hostel facility accommodates thirty six girls and thirty six boys. But the other two floors are not used due to the insufficient support staff and the lack of furniture and other items. The hostel nutrition facility that is the kitchen and the dinning hall was completed in 2011. </p>
<p>The two additional classrooms were sponsored by Operation Jumpstart in 2010. Three therapy rooms, four classrooms, staff room and administrative toilets were completed in 2014, through the DOE funding. This has assisted the school in providing extended floor space in order to enrol more learners.</p>
<p>The school is very proud to have good relationship with local ordinary Public Schools. Ekukhanyeni Special School is also proud to forster partnership with Durban Universuty of Technology (DUT).</p>
